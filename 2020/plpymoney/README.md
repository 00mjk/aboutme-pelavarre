How should we convince me to show up and plan how I spend money?

There is no reasonably simple solution? Really none? Still today in 2020?

I see now I'm writing Python code to break thru the trivial Chase Bank copy restrictions, just to hold my interest in the topic long enough to sketch some graphs of where all our money goes

<=

1 ) I'd say our patterns of spending are yearly and monthly and weekly - I'd say we won't properly count the cost of weekly and monthly and unending subscriptions unless we multiply them out to look at them as yearly costs

2 ) Last April I did sign up Intuit Mint to start watching our transactions - But they take forever to get started - As of now it's just eight months later so they still don't have a whole year of data to work from, and the Chase Bank copy-restrictions seem to have cut them off from looking back farther in time

3 ) Intuit Mint gives me no sketch of graphs where the money goes - just voluminous tables that do categorize the expenses but don't graph them

4 ) Chase Bank gives me two kinds of Pdf printouts of spreadsheets, going back years and years, but not the spreadsheets themselves

5 ) Given this disaster, for awhile middle of this year I did try make myself transcribe the transactions into a spreadsheet as they happened - That was just too involved to get it done in real time, and too boring for me to cope in review, I couldn't keep it going

6 ) Last month I gave Chase Bank enough mouse clicks to download nearly a year's worth of Pdf's, and yesterday I showed up to download the twelfth month of them
