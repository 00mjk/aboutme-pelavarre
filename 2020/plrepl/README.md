# plrepl

## What's here

The first of a few REPL's, this first one being a REPL of the Oct/2019 Bel Language from Y Combinator's P Graham

We're growing it to become as specified, just one example input line at a time

## Define REPL

Wikipedia tells us:

A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single input lines, evaluates them, and prints the result; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. The term is usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic Lisp machine interactive environment. Common examples include command line shells and similar environments for programming languages, and the technique is very characteristic of scripting languages.

## Why write a REPL

In real conversation, I can't control what we say, how long it takes, or where it goes \[TGross STurkle 2012\]

To get into real conversation with an app, I have to get into talking with the app about what it does, I have to step up out of just telling it what to do \[PGreenspun 1993, CMoore 1970\]

It should welcome such engagement, meet me where I am, speak my language, not require me to learn its language

As an example, code written as C welcomes you to call it from Python - Ok great, so far so good, but should code written as Python then welcome us to call it from somewhere farther up?

What should farther up look like?

Shouldn't there be a better way to abbreviate my input?
