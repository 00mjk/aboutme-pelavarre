# icon-pelavarre

My icon is visual, textual, algebraic, and original

It puns on firmware, hardware, marketing, and leadership

1 ) Taken visually, my icon is a demux, flowing left to right, labeled inside with '&' and '-'

A demux listens to all voices at once, and chooses which to forward when

2 ) Taken visually and textually, my icon remixes together two cultures of sketching circuits: non-rectangular shapes from the States and text-inside from Europe

3 ) Taken algebraically, my icon is the (x &- x) expression of the C programming language

That expression picks out the rightmost bit to survive and clears the rest

All together, my icon is a distillation of a small flood of right moves: it rewards study with pun and paradox

My icon can mean to you what you want it to mean, and those choices can spark real conversation between you and me
